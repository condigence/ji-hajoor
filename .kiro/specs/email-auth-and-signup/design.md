# Design Document — Email Sign-Up, Email/Password Sign-In, Agency Sign-Up and Staff Invitations

## Overview

Implements [requirements.md](requirements.md). The Auth_Service gains email credentials, email
verification, password reset, staff invitations and an email port; the Provider_Service gains agency
applications on top of the existing Tenant model; the three apps gain sign-up, email sign-in and the
related screens. No new service.

### Key decisions

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Email lives on `auth.user_account` (nullable, unique on `lower(email)`), with `email_verified_at` and `display_name` | One account per person across roles (platform Requirement 1.14); existing OTP accounts are untouched. |
| D2 | Unverified sign-ups are accounts in status `PENDING_VERIFICATION` | Reuses the account and status machinery (`AccountStatus`), so sign-in, refresh and introspection already refuse them; a sweep removes ones older than 24 h. |
| D3 | Codes and reset tokens live in Redis next to the OTP store | Same TTL, attempt-count and rate-limit pattern as OTP (`RedisOtpStore`, `RedisLoginAttemptStore`). |
| D4 | Invitations are a table in the `auth` schema | They must survive restarts for 7 days and be listed and revoked. Only the SHA-256 of the token is stored. |
| D5 | Agency sign-up = a basic account + a Tenant in `PENDING_APPROVAL` | No role is granted before approval; approval reuses the existing "add Tenant admin" path (grant `TENANT_ADMIN`). |
| D6 | The Auth_Service owns all email delivery | One email port and one place that holds templates; the Provider_Service asks for agency decision emails through an internal endpoint. |

## Components and Interfaces

### auth-service

**Data** — migration `V4__email_credentials.sql`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE auth.user_account ADD COLUMN email varchar(254), ADD COLUMN email_verified_at timestamptz,
  ADD COLUMN display_name varchar(80);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_user_account_email ON auth.user_account (lower(email)) WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
-- AccountStatus gains PENDING_VERIFICATION: widen the status check constraint.
CREATE TABLE auth.staff_invitation (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY, email varchar(254) NOT NULL, role varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  token_hash char(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE, invited_by uuid NOT NULL, created_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL, accepted_at timestamptz, accepted_user_id uuid, revoked_at timestamptz,
  CHECK (role IN ('ADMIN','FINANCE_ADMIN','DISPATCHER','SUPPORT_AGENT')));
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_staff_invitation_open ON auth.staff_invitation (lower(email))
  WHERE accepted_at IS NULL AND revoked_at IS NULL;
```

**Public endpoints** (no token; routed by the apps' `/api/auth/` proxy like today's `/auth/**`):

| Method & path | Body | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/register/email` | `{displayName, email, mobileNumber, password, role}` | 202 `{status:"CODE_SENT"}` always (enumeration-safe); 409 `MOBILE_IN_USE`; 400 `INVALID_ROLE` / `WEAK_PASSWORD` / `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| `POST /auth/register/email/verify` | `{email, code}` | 200 `TokenResponse` (signed in); 400 `INVALID_CODE`; 410 `CODE_EXPIRED` |
| `POST /auth/register/email/resend` | `{email}` | 202 always; 429 `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` |
| `POST /auth/login/password` | `{identifier, password}` (the old `username` field still accepted) | 200 `TokenResponse`; 401 `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; 403 `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` / `ACCOUNT_DISABLED` |
| `POST /auth/password/forgot` | `{email}` | 202 always |
| `POST /auth/password/reset` | `{email, code, newPassword}` | 204; 400 `INVALID_CODE`; revokes all refresh families |
| `GET /auth/invitations/{token}` | — | 200 `{email, role, invitedByName, expiresAt, existingAccount}`; 410 `INVITATION_EXPIRED` |
| `POST /auth/invitations/{token}/acceptance` | new account `{displayName, mobileNumber, password}` or existing `{password}` | 200 `TokenResponse` |

**Signed-in endpoints**: `GET /auth/me` → `{userId, displayName, email, emailVerified, mobileNumber, roles}`;
`POST /auth/me/email` `{email, currentPassword?}` → 202 code sent; `POST /auth/me/email/verify` `{code}` →
204; `PUT /auth/me/password` `{currentPassword?, newPassword}` → 204 (`currentPassword` required when a
password exists).

**Admin endpoints** (`/admin/invitations`, gateway route to auth-service):
`GET /admin/invitations` (open ones), `POST /admin/invitations {email, role}` → 201, `DELETE
/admin/invitations/{id}` → 204. RBAC: ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN; the service enforces that only SUPER_ADMIN may
invite `ADMIN` (403 `SUPER_ADMIN_REQUIRED`).

**Internal**: `POST /internal/emails/agency-decision {userId, tenantName, approved, reason?}` → 202
(provider-service is the caller).

**Email port**: `EmailSenderPort.send(to, subject, body)` with `FileEmailSenderAdapter` (appends to
`homefix.email.file-path`, default `/var/log/homefix/dev-mail.log`; Compose mounts it next to the dev SMS
log as `docker/dev-mail/dev-mail.log`) and `LoggingEmailSenderAdapter` (default; logs recipient and
subject only). Selected by `homefix.email.provider` (`file` | `logging`), mirroring `homefix.sms.provider`.

**Codes**: 6 digits from `SecureRandom`, stored hashed in Redis per purpose (`signup`, `reset`, `email-change`)
with a 10-minute TTL and an attempt counter (max 5); rate limits in Redis per email and per IP (resend ≥ 60 s
apart, ≤ 5/h; sign-up and reset ≤ 10/h per IP).

**Sign-up flow**: validate → if the email belongs to an active account, email "you already have an account"
and answer 202; if the mobile belongs to another account (active or pending < 24 h), 409 `MOBILE_IN_USE`;
otherwise create or replace a `PENDING_VERIFICATION` account (pending ones older than 24 h are replaced) with
the role, hash the password, send the code, 202. Verify → status `ACTIVE`, `email_verified_at`, tokens.

**Sweep**: `@Scheduled` hourly removal of `PENDING_VERIFICATION` accounts older than 24 h.

### provider-service

- `TenantStatus` gains `PENDING_APPROVAL` and `REJECTED` (migration widening the check; `tenant` gains
  `rejection_reason varchar(500)`, `applicant_user_id uuid`).
- `POST /tenant-applications` (any authenticated user; RBAC rule `POST /tenant-applications` for all roles)
  with the Tenant body → 201 `{tenantId, name, status}`; 409 `APPLICATION_EXISTS` if the user already has a
  pending or active agency or administers one.
- `GET /tenant-applications/me` → `{tenantId, name, status, rejectionReason}` or 404.
- `POST /admin/tenants/{id}/approval` → `ACTIVE` + add the applicant as admin (existing grant path) + decision
  email; `POST /admin/tenants/{id}/rejection {reason}` → `REJECTED` + decision email; 409 when not pending.
- `GET /admin/tenants?status=` filter; coverage keeps returning `ACTIVE` only.
- Gateway: route `/tenant-applications/**` to provider-service.

### Apps

- **customer-app / provider-app**: the login screen gains an **Email** tab (email + password, "Forgot
  password?", "Create account"); a sign-up screen (name, email, mobile, password, confirm) → a code screen
  (6-box input, reused from OTP, with resend) → signed in; a reset flow (email → code + new password); an
  `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` sign-in offers to resend and opens the code screen; Profile gains "Email & password".
  Role sent: `CUSTOMER` / `SERVICE_PROVIDER` respectively.
- **admin-portal**: password sign-in field labelled "Email or username"; **Register your agency** (account
  step reusing the email sign-up endpoints with role `CUSTOMER`, then the agency form), an **application
  status** page for signed-in applicants without a staff role; **Accept invitation** page at
  `/invite/:token`; Users module gains an **Invitations** tab (invite, list, revoke); Tenants module gains a
  **Pending applications** filter with approve / reject.

## Correctness Properties

### Property EA1: No enumeration
*For any* email, the responses to sign-up, resend and password-reset requests SHALL be identical in status and
body whether or not the email is registered. **Validates: 1.3, 3.1, 8.2**

### Property EA2: Codes are single-use and bounded
*For any* code, at most one successful use SHALL be possible, it SHALL be rejected after 10 minutes or after 5
wrong attempts. **Validates: 1.6, 3.3**

### Property EA3: No path to a privileged role
*For any* sequence of public or self-service requests, no Account SHALL gain `SUPER_ADMIN`, and Staff_Roles
SHALL be gained only through an invitation created by an authorised admin. **Validates: 6.1, 8.4**

### Property EA4: Pending agencies are inert
*For any* Tenant not `ACTIVE`, it SHALL cover no booking and its applicant SHALL hold no `TENANT_ADMIN` role.
**Validates: 5.3**

### Property EA5: Reset ends sessions
*For any* successful password reset, every refresh-token family of the Account issued before the reset SHALL be
revoked. **Validates: 3.2**

## Testing Strategy

Unit and web-layer tests per endpoint in each module's style; Redis-backed stores tested with the in-memory
fakes used by the OTP tests; enumeration-safety tests compare full responses; invitation token hashing and
expiry; agency approval through the auth stub. End to end: extend `docker/verify-outbox-flow.sh` (or a new
`docker/verify-signup.sh`) reading codes and invitation links from `docker/dev-mail/dev-mail.log`.

## Open Questions

1. A production email provider (SES, SendGrid…) — only the port and local adapters are built.
2. Should agency applications also require document verification of the company?
