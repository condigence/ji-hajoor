/**
 * Rescues bookings whose provider search was lost (review 17.5 item 4). The Dispatch Engine
 * acknowledges {@code BookingCreated} before it searches, so an outage or restart mid-search left
 * the booking in SEARCHING_PROVIDER for good: nobody would ever report that the search ended, the
 * customer was never told, and the booking never reached the Tenant fallback.
 *
 * <p>Every minute, each booking that entered SEARCHING_PROVIDER longer than
 * {@code jihajoor.booking.provider-search-timeout} ago (default 60 minutes, well beyond the longest
 * legitimate search) is settled through {@link DispatchOutcomeService#expireStalledSearch}, exactly
 * as if the Dispatch Engine had reported that nobody accepted: the covering Tenants' queue, or
 * SEARCHING_FAILED with the customer told through the state-driven {@code BookingCancelled}, which
 * also tells a still-running search to stop. Requeuing the search instead would need a new
 * dispatch request event and could repeat the same loss, so it is not attempted.
 *
 * <p>The outcome service does its HTTP lookups outside any transaction and applies the result in a
 * short one that re-reads the booking; a booking accepted or cancelled since it was listed is
 * refused there as an illegal transition, and a concurrent change as an optimistic-lock failure.
 * Both are expected and skipped, and a failure on one booking never stops the batch. A dispatch
 * acceptance that arrives after the sweep is refused (the booking is no longer SEARCHING_PROVIDER).
