/**
 * Settles additional quotes the customer never answered (Requirement 9.9): every minute, each
 * booking that entered CUSTOMER_APPROVAL_PENDING longer than
 * {@code jihajoor.booking.additional-quote-timeout} ago (default 60 minutes) is completed at its
 * original price by {@link JobExecutionService#autoResolveApprovalTimeout}, with the system recorded
 * as the actor. That method existed from the start but nothing called it, so an unanswered quote
 * held the job open indefinitely.
 *
 * <p>The time the booking entered the state comes from its audit trail; the most recent entry
 * counts, since a second parts request after an approval starts a new wait. Each booking is settled
 * in its own short transaction that re-reads it and re-checks both the state and the deadline, and
 * the booking's optimistic lock settles a race with the customer's own answer or another instance's
 * sweep: one commits, the other's {@link OptimisticLockingFailureException} is expected and skipped.
 * A failure on one booking never stops the batch. Same shape as {@link AssignmentTimeoutSweeper}.
