/**
 * The assigned Provider's answer to a Tenant assignment (Requirement MT-6): accept, and the job
 * proceeds exactly like an automatically matched one; decline, and it goes back to the assigning
 * Tenant's queue.
 *
 * <p><b>Who may answer.</b> Only the Provider the booking is assigned to (Requirement MT-6.3). This
 * is stricter than {@link BookingAccess#requireForProvider}, which also admits staff: the answer is
 * the Provider's consent (design D6), which nobody can give on their behalf. Everyone else gets the
 * same 404 as for a missing booking.
 *
 * <p><b>Acceptance.</b> PROVIDER_ASSIGNED -> PROVIDER_ACCEPTED, and a {@code ProviderAccepted}
 * outbox row with the Dispatch Engine's payload in the same transaction, so chat opens the channel
 * and notification tells the customer just as for an automatic acceptance (Requirement MT-6.1,
 * Property MT7). It is written here rather than by {@link BookingLifecycleEventPublisher} because
 * the automatic path enters PROVIDER_ACCEPTED too, and there the Dispatch Engine publishes it.
 *
 * <p><b>Decline.</b> PROVIDER_ASSIGNED -> AWAITING_ASSIGNMENT with the Provider cleared. The Tenant
 * and the original queue time stay, so the booking returns to that Tenant only and the assignment
 * timeout keeps running from when it was first queued (Requirement MT-6.2, MT-7.2). Only a booking
 * that came through the Tenant fallback can be declined back into the queue (Property MT1).
