/**
 * The Tenant Portal's side of booking-service (Requirements MT-5, MT-8.3): a Tenant_Admin's
 * Assignment_Queue, their Tenant's bookings, and the assignment of a queued booking to one of the
 * Tenant's Providers.
 *
 * <h2>Isolation (Requirement MT-10, Property MT5)</h2>
 * The caller's Tenant always comes from their identity ({@link CallerTenantResolver}); nothing in a
 * request names a Tenant. A booking is <em>visible</em> to a Tenant when the Tenant serves it
 * ({@code tenant_id}) or was one of its Candidate_Tenants; anything else answers the same 404 as a
 * missing booking (Requirement MT-5.6). A visible booking may be <em>assigned</em> by the Tenant
 * only while it is AWAITING_ASSIGNMENT and either has no Tenant yet (the Tenant is a candidate) or
 * was returned to this Tenant by its Provider's decline (Requirement MT-5.2); otherwise 409
 * {@code BOOKING_NOT_ASSIGNABLE}, which is also what the loser of a race sees.
 *
 * <h2>Assignment and the race (Requirement MT-5.4, Property MT3)</h2>
 * The booking is read and checked, the Provider's assignability is asked of the Provider Service
 * (outside any transaction: it is an HTTP call), and then the read copy is merged back in a short
 * transaction. The merge carries the version that was read, so if another Tenant_Admin's assignment
 * committed in between, the booking's optimistic lock rejects this one and the caller gets 409; at
 * most one assignment can ever commit. Tenant, Provider, the transition to PROVIDER_ASSIGNED, its
 * audit row and the {@code ProviderAssigned} outbox row (now naming the Tenant) share that
 * transaction (Requirement MT-5.3).
