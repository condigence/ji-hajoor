 * provider not explicitly configured, so "nobody accepts" is the easy default. Within a wave the
 * first provider (in wave order) scripted to accept takes the job; everyone else in that wave reads
 * as withdrawn (TIMED_OUT) unless they were scripted to decline. Optionally asserts that every
 * provider's exclusive lock is held at the moment the wave is offered.
