/**
 * Outbound port for the dispatch signalling that goes to people rather than services: the
 * dispatcher-team alert when all radius cycles are exhausted (Requirement 8.9) and the push that
 * tells a provider a job offer is waiting (Requirement 8.5). The concrete transport is hidden so
 * these paths are unit-testable.
 *
 * <p>The customer's "no provider available" notice is deliberately not here. The Booking Service
 * publishes {@code BookingCancelled} with {@code status = SEARCHING_FAILED} in the same transaction
 * that fails the booking, and the Notification Service turns that event into the customer's notice
 * on every channel. A separate call from the Dispatch Engine duplicated it — or would have, had the
 * endpoint it called ever existed.
 *
 * <p>Every method is best-effort: implementations must log and swallow delivery failures, never
 * throw, because none of these notices may break or stall dispatch.
