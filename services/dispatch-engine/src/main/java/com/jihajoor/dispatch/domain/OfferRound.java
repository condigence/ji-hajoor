/**
 * Every offer made for one booking (Requirements 8.5-8.7). Dispatch offers a booking to several
 * providers at once, in waves, so the offers are kept together and changed as one value: that is
 * what makes "the first provider to accept wins" atomic. Accepting withdraws every other offer
 * still pending in the same transition, so a second provider can never accept the same job.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link JobOffer}, the transitions are pure functions; the store applies them under a
 * compare-and-set. Offers are only ever added or changed, never removed, and at most one offer per
 * provider is kept: re-offering a provider replaces their earlier (terminal) offer.
 *
 * @param bookingId the booking on offer
 * @param offers    the offers in the order they were made
