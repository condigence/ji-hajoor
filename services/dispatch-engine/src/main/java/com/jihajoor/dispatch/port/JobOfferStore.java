 * Shared storage for in-flight job offers (Requirements 8.5-8.7). The dispatch thread that made an
 * offer and the provider-facing API that records the provider's answer may run on different

 * than in memory.
 *
 * <p>A booking's offers are stored together as one {@link OfferRound}, because a booking is
 * offered to several providers at once and accepting one must withdraw the others atomically. The
 * store knows nothing about the offer state machine: callers pass the transition (one of the pure
 * functions on {@link OfferRound}) to {@link #update}, and the store's only job is to apply it
 * atomically against concurrent writers.
