/**
 * Core dispatch orchestration (Requirements 8.2-8.11). Given a {@link DispatchRequest} it:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>queries eligible providers within the current radius (Requirement 8.2);</li>
 *   <li>scores and ranks them using the active {@link MatchingWeights} (Requirement 8.3);</li>
 *   <li>offers the job in <em>waves</em>: the best-ranked {@code offerBatchSize} providers are
 *       offered it at the same time, each under an exclusive per-provider Redis lock
 *       (Requirement 8.11). The first to accept takes the job and the other offers in the wave
 *       are withdrawn in the same atomic write (Requirement 8.5);</li>
 *   <li>when a provider is busy — their lock is held by another booking's open offer — they are
 *       left for a later wave; when everyone left is busy, waits for them (at most one offer
 *       window) before giving up on the radius. A busy provider has not seen this job, so they are
 *       not dropped from the pool the way a decliner is;</li>
 *   <li>on acceptance, records it durably, transitions the booking to PROVIDER_ACCEPTED and
 *       publishes ProviderAccepted (Requirement 8.6) — see {@link AcceptanceLedger} for why the
 *       record comes first;</li>
 *   <li>when nobody in a wave accepts, publishes ProviderRejected for each provider who declined or
 *       let the offer time out, drops them from the pool and offers the next wave (Requirement 8.7);</li>
 *   <li>when a radius is exhausted with no acceptance, expands by the configured increment up to
 *       the cycle limit (Requirement 8.8);</li>
 *   <li>once {@code agencyFallbackMinutes} have passed without an acceptance, or every cycle is
 *       exhausted sooner, hands the booking to the Booking Service, which routes it to the partner
 *       agencies covering it (AWAITING_ASSIGNMENT, Requirement MT-4.2) or fails it, and then the
 *       dispatcher team is alerted (Requirement 8.9). The customer is told by the Notification
 *       Service, from the {@code BookingCancelled} the Booking Service publishes for
 *       SEARCHING_FAILED. No wave's window runs past that deadline.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Only an answer from the Provider Service counts towards "nobody available". When the
 * eligible-provider query cannot be made ({@link ProviderSearchUnavailableException}: an outage, an
 * open breaker, a refused service credential) it is retried for up to one offer window; if the
 * Provider Service is still unavailable the run is abandoned with an ERROR and the exception, as a
 * Booking Service outage on the SEARCHING_FAILED transition ends it, and the booking is left in
 * SEARCHING_PROVIDER for the customer to cancel. It is never failed as having no provider on the
 * strength of a search that did not happen.
 *
 * <p>The search stops early, quietly, once the booking no longer needs a provider: the
 * {@code BookingCancelled} flag is checked before every wave and again before declined or
 * unanswered offers are announced, and a 409/404 from the Booking Service on either terminal
 * transition ({@link BookingNotSearchableException}) ends the run the same way.
 *
 * <p>All external effects are behind ports so the whole algorithm is exercised with deterministic
 * fakes in unit tests. The class is stateless and thread-safe: it is invoked concurrently from the
 * emergency and scheduled bulkhead thread pools.
