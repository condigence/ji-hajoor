 * Outbound port to the Provider Service for finding eligible providers for a booking

 * never reads provider tables directly; it queries the Provider Service, which applies the
 * eligibility filters (APPROVED verification status, at least one matching skill tag, emergency
 * availability when required) and returns pre-computed {@code ScoreComponents}.
 *
 * <p>Abstracting this behind a port keeps the dispatch orchestration testable with a
 * deterministic fake and lets the transport (HTTP today) change without touching the algorithm.
