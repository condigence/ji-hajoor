/**
 * Durable record of provider acceptances that have not yet been fully applied (Requirement 8.6).
 *
 * <p>An acceptance has two effects in two systems: the Booking Service's PROVIDER_ACCEPTED
 * transition (an HTTP call) and this service's {@code ProviderAccepted} event (an outbox row). No
 * transaction spans both, so writing them one after the other was a dual write: a failure between
 * them — the outbox database briefly unavailable, or the process stopping — left a booking accepted
 * with no event, and nothing ever wrote it. Chat never activated, and the customer was never told.
 *
 * <p>The ledger closes that gap by recording the acceptance <em>before</em> either effect:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #open} — the acceptance is committed locally;</li>
 *   <li>the Booking Service is asked for the transition (idempotent for the same provider);</li>
 *   <li>{@link #announce} — in <em>one</em> local transaction, the entry is removed and the
 *       {@code ProviderAccepted} outbox row written.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Whatever fails after step 1 leaves the entry in place, and the {@code AcceptanceReconciler}
 * repeats steps 2 and 3 until they succeed or the Booking Service definitively refuses (the booking
 * was cancelled meanwhile), in which case the entry is {@link #discard discarded} and no event is
 * written. Every acceptance the Booking Service applied is therefore announced at least once, and in
 * practice exactly once: {@link #announce} writes the event only if it is the call that removed the
 * entry, so two runners racing on the same entry cannot both publish.
