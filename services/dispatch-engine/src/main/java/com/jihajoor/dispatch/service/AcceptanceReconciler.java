/**
 * Finishes provider acceptances that the dispatch thread could not (Requirement 8.6): every 30 s,
 * each {@link AcceptanceLedger} entry that is due is retried.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If the Booking Service has not yet confirmed the transition, it is asked again. The request
 *       is idempotent for the same provider, so asking twice is harmless.</li>
 *   <li>Once it has, the entry is announced: removed and {@code ProviderAccepted} written to the
 *       outbox in one transaction.</li>
 *   <li>A 409 or 404 ({@link BookingNotSearchableException}) means the booking will never be this
 *       provider's — typically the customer cancelled while the Booking Service was unreachable — so
 *       the entry is discarded without an event.</li>
 *   <li>Anything else is a transient failure: the entry is postponed with backoff and retried on a
 *       later pass, however long the outage lasts.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Several instances may run this at once. Each entry is handled independently, the Booking
 * Service call is idempotent, and {@link AcceptanceLedger#announce} writes the event only for the
 * runner that removed the entry, so a race costs a duplicate HTTP call at most, never a second
 * event. A failure on one entry never stops the batch.
