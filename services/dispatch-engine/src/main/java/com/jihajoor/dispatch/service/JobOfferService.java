/**
 * The job-offer state machine as the rest of the Dispatch Engine uses it (Requirements 8.5-8.7):
 * the dispatch loop opens a wave of offers and later closes it on timeout, the provider-facing API
 * reads and decides them, and booking cancellation withdraws them.
 *
 * <p>A booking's offers form one {@link OfferRound}, and every change goes through
 * {@link JobOfferStore#update} with one of its pure transitions. Providers' decisions and the
 * wave's timeout therefore race on a single atomic compare-and-set: the first accept wins, takes
 * the booking and withdraws everyone else's offer in the same write, and any later accept is
 * refused as {@link Decision.Outcome#TAKEN}. The store entry outlives the window by
 * {@link #RETENTION_GRACE} so the dispatch thread can still read a decision made in the last
 * instant, and providers can still see why a late accept was refused.
 *
 * <p>Registered by {@code DispatchAdaptersConfig} (it needs the Redis-backed store and a clock).
