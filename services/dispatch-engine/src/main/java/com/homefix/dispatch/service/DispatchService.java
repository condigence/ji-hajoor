/**
 * Core dispatch orchestration (Requirements 8.2-8.11). Given a {@link DispatchRequest} it:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>queries eligible providers within the current radius (Requirement 8.2);</li>
 *   <li>scores and ranks them using the active {@link MatchingWeights} (Requirement 8.3);</li>
 *   <li>walks the ranking highest-first, acquiring an exclusive per-provider Redis lock before
 *       each offer (Requirement 8.11) and offering the job (Requirement 8.5);</li>
 *   <li>when a provider is busy — their lock is held by another booking's open offer — goes on to
 *       the next candidate, then waits for the busy ones (at most one offer window) before giving
 *       up on the radius. A busy provider has not seen this job, so they are not dropped from the
 *       pool the way a decliner is;</li>
 *   <li>on acceptance, transitions the booking to PROVIDER_ACCEPTED and publishes ProviderAccepted
 *       (Requirement 8.6);</li>
 *   <li>on reject/timeout, publishes ProviderRejected, drops that provider from the pool and moves
 *       to the next (Requirement 8.7);</li>
 *   <li>when a radius is exhausted with no acceptance, expands by the configured increment up to
 *       the cycle limit (Requirement 8.8);</li>
 *   <li>if all cycles are exhausted, asks the Booking Service to fail the booking and fires the
 *       customer + dispatcher notifications (Requirement 8.9) — unless it routed the booking to
 *       partner agencies instead (AWAITING_ASSIGNMENT, Requirement MT-4.2).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The search stops early, quietly, once the booking no longer needs a provider: the
 * {@code BookingCancelled} flag is checked before every offer and again before a declined or
 * unanswered offer is announced, and a 409/404 from the Booking Service on either terminal
 * transition ({@link BookingNotSearchableException}) ends the run the same way. Without this a
 * cancelled booking kept being offered to, and rejected by, every remaining candidate.
 *
 * <p>All external effects are behind ports so the whole algorithm is exercised with deterministic
 * fakes in unit tests. The class is stateless and thread-safe: it is invoked concurrently from the
 * emergency and scheduled bulkhead thread pools.
