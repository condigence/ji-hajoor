-- Provider acceptances recorded but not yet fully applied (Requirement 8.6). See
-- com.jihajoor.dispatch.port.AcceptanceLedger: a row is written before the Booking Service is asked
-- for PROVIDER_ACCEPTED and deleted in the same transaction as the ProviderAccepted outbox row, so a
-- failure between the two can be retried by the AcceptanceReconciler instead of losing the event.
--
-- The first versioned migration of this schema. V1 is the baseline (spring.flyway.baseline-version),
-- which has no file because the Dispatch Engine had no tables of its own before this one: an existing
-- database is baselined at V1 and gets this migration, a new one simply runs it.
--
-- Mirrors com.jihajoor.dispatch.domain.PendingAcceptance exactly (ddl-auto=validate checks it).
