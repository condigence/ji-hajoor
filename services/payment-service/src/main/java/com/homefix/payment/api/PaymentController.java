/**
 * REST surface for the Payment Service (Requirement 12, 14.3-14.4).
 *
 * <p>Gateway callbacks live under {@code /payments/callbacks/**}, which is permitted without JWT
 * auth in {@code WebSecurityConfig}; they are authenticated instead by cryptographic signature
 * verification in {@link PaymentService#handleGatewayCallback} (Requirement 12.5).
 *
 * <p>Role-based access is enforced by {@code PaymentRbacConfig}; on top of it, the customer-facing
 * endpoints assert <em>ownership</em> via {@link CallerIdentity} so a customer cannot read another
 * customer's transaction, pay for somebody else's booking, or push another customer's
 * PENDING payment towards FAILED through the retry endpoint. The callback, refund, reconcile and
 * settlement handlers carry no ownership check: the callback has no authenticated principal at all
 * (it is HMAC-verified), and refunds/reconciliation/settlements are staff-only by role.
 *
 * <p>{@code @PathVariable}/{@code @RequestParam} names are spelled out explicitly because the build
 * does not enable the {@code -parameters} compiler flag, and Spring 6 no longer falls back to the
 * local-variable table to infer them.
