/**
 * Pays for a completed booking (Requirement 12.2, 12.3, 12.10): the customer-facing
 * {@code POST /payments} flow.
 *
 * <p>The client names only the booking and the payment method. Who pays, who is credited and how
 * much all come from the Booking Service's payment facts, and the platform fee from the default
 * percentage rule, so a client can no longer pay a different amount, credit a different provider or
 * open a payment in another customer's name.
 *
 * <p>Order of steps, and why:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Read the booking's facts. The caller must be the booking's customer, or staff paying on the
 *       customer's behalf; anybody else gets the same 404 as for a booking that does not exist.</li>
 *   <li>Return the live payment for (booking customer, booking) if there is one. This comes before
 *       the status check because after a successful payment the booking is PAYMENT_COMPLETED, and a
 *       duplicate request must still get its payment rather than a 409.</li>
 *   <li>Require a payable status (JOB_COMPLETED, CUSTOMER_CONFIRMED or PAYMENT_PENDING).</li>
 *   <li>Check the gateway exists, then move the booking to PAYMENT_PENDING, then charge through
 *       {@link PaymentService#initiatePayment}. The booking moves first so a charge is never taken on
 *       a booking that could not be marked as awaiting payment.</li>
 * </ol>
 * If the Booking Service cannot answer at any step the request fails with
 * {@code 503 BOOKING_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE} before anything is charged.
 *
 * <p>The transaction's customer is always the booking's customer, never a staff caller's id, so
 * idempotency, ownership checks on later reads and the PaymentCompleted event all name the customer
 * who owes the money.
