 * {@link #isSelfAssignable()}. The staff roles are granted out of band (by an
 * existing administrator, or by the local seeding script) because a caller must
 * never be able to name their own privileged role at registration time.
 *
 * <p>The staff roles below are the ones the rest of the platform already checks
 * for: {@code SUPER_ADMIN} gates System Configuration in admin-service,
 * {@code FINANCE_ADMIN} gates reconciliation and settlement reports in
 * reporting-service, and {@code DISPATCHER} and {@code SUPPORT_AGENT} appear in
 * the requirements as the manual-assignment and complaint-handling actors.
 *
 * <p>{@link #TENANT_ADMIN} is not platform staff: it administers one service agency (a Tenant)
 * inside the marketplace and reaches only the Tenant Portal. It is granted and revoked by
 * provider-service, which owns Tenants, through the internal role endpoints when a Platform_Admin
 * adds or removes a Tenant administrator (Requirement MT-2.1, MT-2.2, MT-2.4).
