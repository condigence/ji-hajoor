 * reaching bcrypt. Strength rules belong wherever credentials are issued, not at sign-in,
 * because tightening them later must not lock out accounts that already exist.
 *
 * @param identifier an email address or a console username, case-insensitive. The field was
 *                   called {@code username} before email sign-in existed, and that name is still
 *                   accepted (email-auth design).
 * @param password   the raw password, verified against the stored bcrypt hash
