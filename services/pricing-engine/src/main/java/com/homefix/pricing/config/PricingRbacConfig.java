/**
 * Populates the shared {@link RbacProperties} allow-list for the Pricing Engine
 * (Requirement 19.6).
 *
 * <p>Spring's relaxed binder cannot bind map keys containing spaces and slashes (e.g.
 * {@code "PUT /admin/**"}) from flat {@code application.yml} strings, so the rules are registered
 * programmatically here.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@code @PostConstruct} and not {@code ApplicationReadyEvent}</h2>
 * <p>The rules must exist <em>before</em> the embedded server starts accepting traffic. Registering
 * them on {@code ApplicationReadyEvent} leaves a window between context refresh (when the web
 * server is already bound and serving) and the event firing, during which
 * {@code RbacEnforcementFilter} finds an empty allow-list; because the filter passes through when
 * no pattern matches, <em>every</em> endpoint — the Admin pricing-parameter writes included —
 * would be open to any caller holding a valid token. {@code @PostConstruct} runs during context
 * refresh, before the server accepts requests, so there is no such window. The method is
 * {@code public} so tests can drive it directly.
 *
 * <h2>Semantics</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Ordering matters.</strong> {@code RbacEnforcementFilter} uses the <em>first</em>
 *       matching entry in this {@code LinkedHashMap}, so the specific {@code /pricing/...} rules
 *       are declared after the {@code /admin/**} block (which cannot match them) and the narrower
 *       {@code /pricing/overrides} rule is declared before the broader estimate rule.</li>
 *   <li><strong>The role list is a logical OR.</strong> A caller holding <em>any</em> one of the
 *       listed roles is admitted; the authority compared is {@code ROLE_<NAME>}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why {@code POST /pricing/estimate} admits more than CUSTOMER</h2>
 * <p>{@code POST /pricing/estimate} is not only called by customers directly. The Booking Service
 * calls it server-to-server while handling a booking request and <em>relays the end user's bearer
 * token</em> rather than using a service identity (see
 * {@code services/booking-service/.../client/BearerTokenRelay.java}). The principal this filter
 * sees on such a call is therefore whoever drove the booking, not a machine account. Bookings can
 * be driven by a customer for themselves, by a provider quoting or adjusting work, and by a
 * dispatcher booking on a customer's behalf, so the rule admits {@code CUSTOMER},
 * {@code SERVICE_PROVIDER} and {@code DISPATCHER} alongside the Admin tier. Narrowing it to
 * {@code CUSTOMER} would make every dispatcher- and provider-initiated booking fail with a 403 on
 * the downstream estimate call.
 *
 * <p>{@code POST /pricing/overrides} only validates a provider-specific price override against the
 * subcategory bounds (Requirement 6.12), so it is restricted to {@code SERVICE_PROVIDER} plus the
 * Admin tier — a customer has no business probing override bounds.
 *
 * <h2>Endpoints deliberately left without a rule</h2>
 * <p>{@code RbacEnforcementFilter} is installed <em>inside</em> the {@code SecurityFilterChain}
 * (see {@link WebSecurityConfig}) via {@code addFilterAfter(...)}, so it runs for every request
 * that reaches the chain — including those that {@code authorizeHttpRequests} marked
 * {@code permitAll()}. A rule matching a public path therefore turns that path into a 401 for
 * anonymous callers. The <strong>health / metrics surface</strong> ({@code /health/**},
 * {@code /actuator/**}, {@code /metrics}, {@code /prometheus}) is consequently left unmapped on
 * purpose: it is scraped by Kubernetes probes and Prometheus, which present no bearer token, and
 * any rule covering those paths would fail every liveness and readiness probe with a 401 and take
 * the service out of rotation.
