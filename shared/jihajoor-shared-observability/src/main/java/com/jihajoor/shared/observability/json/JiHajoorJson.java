/**
 * The platform's JSON settings on top of Jackson 3's defaults, shared by every service's
 * {@code JsonMapper} (through {@link JiHajoorJacksonAutoConfiguration}) and by tests that build a
 * mapper of their own, such as a standalone MockMvc.
 *
 * <p>Jackson 3 turned {@link DeserializationFeature#FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES} on by default:
 * a request that leaves out a {@code boolean} or {@code int} field would be refused as unreadable
 * (a bare 400) instead of the field taking its default and the request reaching validation.
 * The API contracts were written against Jackson 2's behaviour, so it is kept.
