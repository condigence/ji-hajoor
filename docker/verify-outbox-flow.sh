# Verifies the transactional-outbox path end to end against the running local stack.
#
# This exists because the outbox was silently broken: every producer wrote its
# event rows into its own schema while the relay polled a different one, so no
# domain event was ever published and nothing downstream ever ran. A green
# unit-test suite did not catch it, because the defect lived in configuration
# and schema placement rather than in code. This script checks the real thing.
#
# What it asserts, in order:
#   1. the shared outbox schema exists and holds the outbox tables
#   2. confirming a booking writes a PENDING outbox row
#   3. the relay flips that row to PUBLISHED within a few seconds
#   4. the event actually lands on its Kafka topic
#   5. dispatch matches it: it resolves the address and skill tags, offers the job to the
#      seeded test provider, and the provider's acceptance moves the booking to
#      PROVIDER_ACCEPTED and publishes ProviderAccepted
#   6. the provider can run the job the way the provider app does, through the gateway:
#      the job detail carries the address, someone else's token cannot drive the booking,
#      on the way -> arrived (with a location the customer can read) -> before photo ->
#      start -> after photo -> complete, with the photo gates enforced
#   8. (after 7) a booking automatic matching cannot place falls back to the Tenant covering it: the
#      seeded provider declines the offer, the booking reaches AWAITING_ASSIGNMENT, the demo Tenant's
#      admin sees it in the queue, assigns Provider Two (who declines), reassigns Provider One (who
#      accepts), and only the Tenant admin can reach the queue. Needs docker/seed-tenants.sql.
#   7. the customer pays for the completed job: the amount comes from the booking (a tampered
#      amount in the request is ignored), the local payment simulator settles it, and the
#      booking reaches PAYMENT_COMPLETED through the PaymentCompleted event, and the provider's
#      wallet is credited once
#
# Step 5 needs the seed data: docker/seed-catalog.sql and docker/seed-provider-profiles.sql
# (an approved provider based in Ara with the plumbing skill tag). The booking is placed
# inside that provider's service radius.

# had the messages. Harmless on Linux and macOS, where the variable is simply unused.
