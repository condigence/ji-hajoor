# Seeds a fixed set of test users into the local HomeFix stack, one per role.
#
# Customers and providers are created through the real public OTP flow, so the
# accounts are indistinguishable from ones a user would create. Privileged roles
# (ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, FINANCE_ADMIN, DISPATCHER, SUPPORT_AGENT) are granted
# out of band with a direct INSERT into auth.user_account_role, because
# self-service registration deliberately refuses to hand out those roles.
#
# Re-running the script is safe: accounts are matched on mobile number and role
# rows are inserted only when missing.
#
# Usage:  bash docker/seed-test-users.sh
#
# Prerequisites: the stack is up (docker compose -f docker-compose.core.yml up -d)
# and auth-service is configured with SMS_PROVIDER=file, which the local compose
# file already does.
